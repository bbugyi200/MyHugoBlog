Every budding Software Engineer longs for the day that one of their GitHub projects gets 100 stars. I am proud to say that I recently hit this coveted milestone (checkout [funky]). I have a [HackerNews post][HN] (that went viral for about 24 hours) to thank for this.

At the time of this writing, [funky] has 317 stars on GitHub. With that said, I imagine that only a small percentage of the users who starred the project have actually continued to use it. In fact, I'm fairly confident that the project has been overcompensated (with stars) considering how much actual use it has seen from the developer community. Alas, I have come to a bitter conclusion: **GitHub Stars != Usefullness**.

This experience has led me to search for a better way. **GitHub stars have long been an insufficient way of determining a repository's worth. It's time for a new scoring system.**

## Rank your GitHub Projects

## Other Possible Scoring Methods

## Can you do better?
